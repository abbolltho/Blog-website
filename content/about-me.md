description: "The happy guy behind The Happy Numbers Blog"
---

Hello! My name is Olle Thor and as you've probbably understood by now, I am the happy guy who created this blog. I was born In 2005 in Sweden and is currently studying programing. 
\
In my free time I like cycling and playing computer games which takes up most of my time.
\
\
I also like math but dos not think that every number is equal. 4 for example is one of my favorites while a number like 61 is really boring with almost nothing going for it.
\
That's in fact the reason I made the blog about numbers since I think everyone should give more appreciation to all of these awsome numbers instead of just seeing all numbers as the same thing.
