title: About The Blog
description: "The ideas and process that made The Happy Numbers Blog possible"
---

This blog was created as a school project when we got the mission to create our own blogs.

Unlike most of my classmates who copied the design of an already existing blog I started of looking around the internet for a nice color palette untill I found <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/70492" class="underline">This</a> really clean looking one created by the user stankpop. 

After finding the color palett I looked at a few generic example blogs and started to sketch out the design of my blog.

Now the only thing left was to actually create the blog. By using vue, nuxt, tailwind-css and trusty old html-javascript I compleated the website.

Some of you might be wondering where the idea of the blog came from, and it is actually really simple: I am a happy guy with opinions on numbers. So why wouldn't I make a blog about numbers and happiness?
