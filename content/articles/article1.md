Since 1 is the first number, I will start of by talking about it.
\
If we look at the design it is essentially just a line. Sometimes we add a few lines more to make it stand out, but that just proves my point, the design for the number 1 is so uninteresting everyone tries to change it to look like more. But in reallity it's just 1.

In math, the number 1 does nothing. Any number multiplied or divided by 1 is still going to be the same number. Technically it's <em>not</em> even a prime number since a prime number has to be dividable by exactly two numbers, 1 and itself wile 1 is only dividable by 1.

This is the reason why no1 on the planet loves the number 1.

(it's not a bad number though, just a boring one)
